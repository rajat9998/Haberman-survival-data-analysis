### Observations:
- The number of positive axii nodes of the survivors is highly densed from 0 to 5.
- Almost 80% of the patients have less than or equal to 5 positive axii nodes.
- The patients treated after 1966 have the slighlty higher chance to surive that the rest. The patients treated before 1959 have the slighlty lower chance to surive that the rest.
